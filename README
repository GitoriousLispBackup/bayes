* Bayes is Bayesian inference engine and GUI modeling tool

* Depends on:

  - Qt4
  - SBCL
  - sfsexp (http://sexpr.sourceforge.net/)

* Compiling process (GNU/Linux)::

  Inside src/ directory issue commands:
    export SEXPR=[path_to_sexpr_library]
    qmake-qt4
    make

  Inside src/lisp/ directory issue commands:
    sbcl --script bayes-cmd.lisp

* Windows compiling process:

  This could be built similary as in GNU/Linux environment using MinGW.
